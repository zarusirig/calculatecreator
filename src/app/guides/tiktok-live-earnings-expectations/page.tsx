      question: 'How much does TikTok take from LIVE gifts?',
      answer: 'TikTok takes approximately 50% of gift value. If a viewer spends $10, you receive ~$5 worth of diamonds.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I earn from LIVE with 1,000 followers?',
      answer: 'Yes, but earnings will be modest ($2–$10 per stream initially). LIVE is worth it for building community and improving earnings as you grow.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to go LIVE every day to earn well?',
      answer: 'No. Consistency matters more than daily streaming. 3–5× per week on a schedule is optimal.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if no one sends gifts during my LIVE?',
      answer: 'Normal at first. Focus on building engaged community. As viewers feel connected, gifts increase naturally. Don\'t pressure—value and entertainment drive gifts.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I ask viewers to send gifts?',
      answer: 'Light encouragement is okay ("Gifts help me keep creating!"). But begging or guilting viewers damages trust. Let gifts come organically.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When can I withdraw my earnings?',
      answer: 'Once you reach $50 (10,000 diamonds). Payment processed via PayPal/bank transfer in 7–10 days.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do LIVE earnings count as income for taxes?',
      answer: 'Yes. LIVE gift earnings are taxable income. Track all earnings for tax filing (1099 in US).',
